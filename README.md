# Unity-ProceduralSceneGenerator

## Description

This is a Unity project that generates a procedural scene using a grid of tiles. The tiles are populated with objects that are randomly selected from a list of prefabs. There are few Generator scripts that can be used to generate different types of scenes. The project also includes a simple UI that can be used to control the generation of the scene.
